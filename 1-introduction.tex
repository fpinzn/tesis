\section{Introduction}
%Motivación.%
For a long time now I've wanted to visit France. Actually, thinking about it, I had that desire before I started to study Systems and Computer Engineering at Universidad de los Andes. Someday I just asked Tiberio about the possibilities of making my thesis abroad. He gave me certain options and one of them was the Institut Image at Chalon-sur-Saône (in which I am writing this Introduction). Since then a few months passed before the bureaucratic nightmare started. 

From the university demanding information they already had, and for which I had to pay a considerable amount of money; to the French Embassy and their Kafkesque process to give me a 5 minutes appointment after weeks of collecting innumerable documents, without taking in account my travel to Brazil to participate in Interactivos? 2010 BH, Christmas and New Year's eve, I thought I wouldn't be able to fly to France in time.  After all it actually happened.

The subject of this work was given to me by Frédéric two weeks after my arrival at Chalon. In normal conditions I prefer my projects to be product of my ideas and not someone else's, but the opportunity to come here for a whole semester easily took over that. Looking backwards, this project has been a great learning opportunity, both personal and professionally.

The instructions for developing my project were simple and precise: A system for making annotations on 3D models using the cave facilities present at the institute, however usable in a standard computer. The idea is to be able to comment collaboratively and in distant locations a 3D model. The annotations would be simply a plain text comment, with an author and a priority attached.

First of all I thank my mother and my sister for supporting me, I know it have been tough. I also thank Tiberio and Frédéric for supervising this work, and giving me this opportunity. Luisa for her friendship and love; David for his friendship and ¿?, and both for their support and our shared memories. Sadly I can't thank God because I don't believe in him, nevertheless I can thank Alan Turing for making this work possible.
