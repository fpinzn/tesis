\subsection{Acceptance Level}

The minimal accepted solution would be the one who fulfills all the requirements (functional and nonfunctional) mentioned before, except the Non Functional Requirement 2. This is, a solution that runs and is fully functional in cave like systems but doesn't work in a standard PC running windows XP.  

The optimal solution in the available time is then, the one described below through the requirements. The description of better global solutions will be reserved for the \emph{Future Work} part of this document as they involve a significantly major development work, involve an external repository of the annotations and timeline functionalities upon the models and their textual information, that are beyond the reach of this project.

An incomplete solution would be developed in the case that the calendar designed for developing the solution falls short due to unforeseen serious technical difficulties during the implementation. In this disgraceful scenario the part of the project that would suffer the most, is without doubt the related to the reviewing of the annotations. This, because the first part that will be implemented is the one concerned with creating the annotations given it's need to afterwards see the annotations made.

On the other hand, another part of the project that could present non-optimal quality is the one concerned with the user experience. The project is thought to be a clean, minimal but satisfying solution to the problem it aims to solve, nevertheless a huge effort is being invested in improving the user experience and the quality attributes related to it. 

Taking in account the ideas presented in the famous book by the creators of the successful company 37signals \cite{37signals} and the Apple Development Guidelines \cite{apple}, a nice user experience involves reducing the span of functional requirements to the minimum necessary to successfully solve the problem, while focusing in less evident goods of the software. In the particular case of the project, the rendering power, the net transmission and the responsivity of the front-end (the Android powered tablet) are the most relevant factors in providing a satisfactory user experience. Is yet to be seen how easy or hard is to tune them rightly.
