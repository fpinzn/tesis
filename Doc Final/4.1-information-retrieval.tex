\section{Information Gathering}
The information sources used to develop the design and the architectural choices where basically the online databases provided by the Universidad de los Andes library site. Being the most used and consulted the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Computer Society Digital Library online libraries . Given the precise instructions to develop the project there wasn't a particular need to search information about the origin of the problem to solve, it was just a need present at the Institute Image, as discussed in previous sections of this document.

The reviosion of the bibliography and references used in articles describing similar projects \cite{Kadobayashi}, \cite{Sonnet}, \cite{Duval} and \cite{Jung}  pointed other useful sources of information; even when they weren't so closely related to the project's subject. These references were used basically to evaluate potential design alternatives, taking in account the reduced number of iterations possible to develop the application, such as \cite{Bernheim}, \cite{Hong}. Other sources of information that influenced the work were known by the author before, such as \cite{apple}, \cite{37signals} and \cite{lidwell2003universal}.
