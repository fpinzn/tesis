\section{Restrictions}
The most significant restrictions at the time of developing the project is, with complete certainty, both the inexperience of the author with the technologies used and the time to deliver it. There wasn't any other technological restriction which could affect the project. Given the nature of the project there weren't any economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, legal, health or security related restrictions \footnote{This remark is made taking into account the ABET directives for such documents.}.

On the other hand, a significant restriction to broad the contexts, in which the application is a relevant solution to a similar problem, is the amount of money needed to build similar immersive facilities to the ones present at the Institut Image or the COLIVRI laboratory at the Universidad de los Andes.
